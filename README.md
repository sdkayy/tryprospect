[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/sdkayy/tryprospect)](https://repl.it/github/sdkayy/tryprospect)

Hi - thank you for applying to Prospect! And thank you for doing this test.

We'd like to keep this simple. The tasks below should ideally not take you more than 30 minutes. 

# ✅ The Project

The application enclosed is a simple todo list app. 

It has a few basic functionalities -- create task, edit, delete, and mark them as completed.

The application is built using React and Redux.

# 📝 The Task

Your task (pun intended) is to fix a bug and add an enhancement.

- **Bug**: You have to find this one! There is one bug that is impeding the app functionality. You will have to use the application a little bit to find it.

- **Enhancement**: We would like you add a "created time" and "completed time" indicator for each task. The created time one should show when the task was added. The completed time should show when the task was done (this is only for completed tasks).

# ⭐️ Extra Details

At the bare minimum we'll be evaluating how well you can fix the bug and add the new enhancement.

However anything extra that you do will give you bonus points. We don't want to share ideas here because this is entirely up to you!

# 🎯 Getting Started and Submission

To get started, hit "fork" in the repl.it editor. This will give you your own privte repl.it space in which you can make changes and test.

Once you are ready to submit, submit the Google Form with your repl.it link and a description of the changes you have made.

# ❓ Help

If you're stuck or need help, please email aamir@tryprospect.com.

Thanks again and all the best!
